# Module-17-Challenge-Resources

Credit risk classification is a major problem for credit card organisations because the data is usually uneven and good loans far outnumber the dangerous loans. As a result, additional strategies are needed to train and assess models with unbalanced classes. 


## Motivation

To predict the risk by reducing sampling issue for uneven data using various techniques like Oversampling, undersampling and over&under sampling + also use two different machine learning models to eliminate bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier.


## Method and results
The methodology was defined in the assignment, methodology and results are shown in the word document in the repository. Shown below are high level deliverables

Deliverable 1: Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk
Deliverable 2: Use the SMOTEENN Algorithm to Predict Credit Risk
Deliverable 3: Use Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk
Deliverable 4: A Written Report on the Credit Risk Analysis (README.md)

## Repository overview

Provide an overview of the directory structure and files, for example:

├── README.md
├── Assignment Report.docx
├── credit_risk_resampling.ipynb
├── credit_risk_ensemble.ipynb



## Running instructions

To run the files you can open it in Jupyter notebooks and run all and that should run all the note book one by one
